Mod for Chris J's Minicraft+.
Adds thirst, support for half hearts so player now has 20 hp instead of default 10 and many more.
Improves world generation so world looks better as well as caverns.
And many more...

I'm going to make mod updates and adding new content.

Inspired by tough as nails, minecraft mod a little bit.
